# TXTY

TXTY is a terminal based text editor written in C.

I started writing it when I started following [Snaptoken's tutorial on Antirez's Kilo](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/)

I started working on it for learning purposes and now halfway through, I have decided that I will add even more features to it after I finishe the tutorial. I will update the readme as I get close to adding new features.
